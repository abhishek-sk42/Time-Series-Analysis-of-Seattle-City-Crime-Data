# Time-Series-Analysis-of-Seattle-City-Crime-Data
I utilized the open source, Seattle City Crime data to to explore trends in crime across the city. Using time series techniques like ARIMA and Prophet, I explored the use of machine learning techniques to predict the volume of crime using historical data ranging from 2008 to 2023. This is purely to evaluate different models on the given dataset and requires further optimization that I will be working on in another project.
